# Procraft
Procraft is a full-featured administration panel for Minecraft server hosting. It runs Minecraft as a headless daemon, while being able to seamlessly send commands to it, read terminal outputs and logs, and do cool stuff like install plugins through a GUI interface.

It also comes with a custom file manager and editor for browsing through the game files and editing configurations, and a Plugin manager to easily install/remove server plugins.
