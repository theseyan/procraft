## Contributing

Contributions to the `jsoneditor` library are very welcome! We can't do this
alone. You can contribute in different ways: spread the word, report bugs, come
up with ideas and suggestions, and contribute to the code.

There are a few preferences regarding code contributions:

-   Send pull requests to the `develop` branch, not the `master` branch.
-   You can use modern JavaScript features, the code is transpiled using Babel.
-   `jsoneditor` follows the https://standardjs.com/ code style. To test:

    ```
    npm run lint
    ```

-   If possible, create a unit test for any new functionality. To run tests:

    ```
    npm test
    ```

Thanks!
